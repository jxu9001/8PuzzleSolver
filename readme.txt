INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE SOLVER
To run the solver, first ensure that the *.py files and the input files are in the same directory.
Next, type "python3 main.py <algorithm_name> <input_file_name>" into the terminal and press enter.
algorithm_name is one of:
    dfs (depth first search)
    bfs (breadth first search (this wasn't required, but I implemented it to calculate the # of moves in the optimal solutions))
    ids (iterative deepening search)
    astar1 (a* search with heuristic 1)
    astar2 (a* search with heuristic 2)
input_file_name is one of:
    input1.txt (easy, optimal solution has 5 moves)
    input2.txt (medium, optimal solution has 9 moves)
    input3.txt (hard, optimal solution has 12 moves)
    input4.txt (very hard, optimal solution has 30 moves)

SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUTS FOR INPUT2.TXT
input2.txt represents the following initial state:
    +---+---+---+
    | 7 |   | 2 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 6 | 4 | 8 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 5 | 3 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+

ANALYSIS OF MY TWO HEURISTICS
I used the two heuristics discussed in the lecture slides.
Heuristic 1: # of misplaced tiles
Heuristic 2: Î£(manhattan distance from each tile to its goal position)
